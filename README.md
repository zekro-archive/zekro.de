# zekro.de

Here you can find some of the code behind my ['zekro.de' web page](https://zekro.de).

This page is 100% self-coded by zekro and a friend helped with some stuff. So this page is not depending on templates or stuff like this.

I know, there is **a lot** bad practice and stuff to do better, so please don't blame and create some nice [**issues**](https://github.com/zekroTJA/zekro.de/issues) and [**pull requests**](https://github.com/zekroTJA/zekro.de/pulls) to make this page better. ;)
